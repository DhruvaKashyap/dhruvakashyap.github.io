How have you stumbled here weary wanderer?
* I like star wars
I was 12 years old when I saw A new hope for the firs time, the ideal age to enjoy that movie. It used play on the television sometime in March, right during my year end exams, but I never missed it.
* I really like it
Over the years I have learned more about George Lucas's philosophy for star wars and have come to appreciate the themes more and more
* I really really like it
Andor. Go watch it.
* Not that much
If I were to distill my love for Star wars, I would say: "I know what Aurebesh is, but I don't speak it." I initially intended on having a bit of Aurebesh text, but rendering it was too much of a pain.
