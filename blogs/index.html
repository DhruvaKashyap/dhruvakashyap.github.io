          I write things when I can because I enjoy doing them. If you read anything here, I hope it is enjoyable to you.
          Please let me know if you think I'm wrong about something! (like a typo). I tend to write them in <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org</a> and export them to HTML.
          This is my personal website, so everything here is personal and doesn't reflect the views of anyone else.

            <h4><a href="website.html">Why is this Web Site so bad?</a></h4>
            TL;DR: I don't like JavaScript, am too lazy to use CSS well, and need help figuring out how to use static site generators.

            <h4><a href="war.html">On the war in Ukraine</a></h4>
            UPDATE[Dec 2022]: I wrote this sometime when the war started and updated it a few weeks later.
            However, it has been almost a year, and things are pretty bad. I still wish that the suffering ends.
            The nuances of this war are far too many for me to be talking about.
            I wrote this tiny piece a while ago, and it is wrong of me to keep it up without updating it.
            However, I do not have the time or knowledge to do justice. Hence, sometime in the future, I will remove it.
            However, it will still be archived on <a href="https://github.com/DhruvaKashyap/dhruvakashyap.github.io">the public GitHub repository</a> on which this website is hosted.

                I love movies and the cinema.
