        Hello there, I'm Dhruva Kashyap. My pronouns are He/Him. I was born in Bengaluru(ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು), India and have lived here all my life.
        <br><br>

        I am very passionate about Computer Science, a field of study that has taught me so much. I hope to entangled in it for a long time. Some of my
        favourite subjects(in no particular order) are Reinforcement Learning, Compilers, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Algorithms and Data
        Structures.

        I believe in the principles of the Free and Open Source Movement.
        <br><br>
        I have many favourite places for food around Bengaluru, but I am a
        vegetarian, so my recommendations will reflect that.
        <ul>
          <li>CTR Malleshwaram</li>
          <li>MTR Lalbagh</li>
        </ul>
        I have many fond memories of being read stories from my grandparents, and I have hence been reading as long as I remember. A few books I can
        recommend:
        <ul>
          <li>Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevsky</li>
          <li>Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury</li>
          <li>Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell</li>
          <li>Lone wolf and Cub(子連れ狼), by writer Kazuo Koike and artist Goseki Kojima</li>
        </ul>
        I also love watching cinema. Some of my favourite Directors are Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, George Lucas,
        Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Bong Joon-Ho, Alfred Hitchcock, Katheryn Bigelow, Quentin Tarantino, Hayao Miyazaki, and many more.
        <br><br>
        I am a big fan of Star Wars. A character I really like is Admiral Raddus, who made his appearance in "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story".
