      <div class="pages">
        Hello there, I'm Dhruva Kashyap. My pronouns are He/Him. I was born in Bengaluru(ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು), India, and have lived here all my life.
        <br><br>

        I am very passionate about Computer Science, a field of study that has taught me much.
        I finished my Undergraduate Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://pes.edu">PES University</a>.
        As of writing this(December 2022), I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science and Engineering from CSA,<a href="https://iisc.ac.in">IISc</a>.

        I have many favorite places for food around Bengaluru, but I am a
        vegetarian, so my recommendations will reflect that. This list is really sparse; please help me expand it!
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Tiffin_Room_Bangalore">CTR, Malleshwaram</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.mavallitiffinrooms.com/">MTR, Lalbagh</a></li>
          <li>Umesh Dosa point, Sheshadripuram</li>
        </ul>
        I have many fond memories of being read stories by my grandparents. I have been reading for as long as I remember. A few books I can
        recommend(Again, a list that I definitely need to make longer):
        <ul>
          <li>Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevsky</li>
          <li>Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury</li>
          <li>Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell</li>
          <li>Lone wolf and Cub(子連れ狼), by writer Kazuo Koike and artist Goseki Kojima</li>
        </ul>
        I also love watching the cinema. Some of my favorite Directors are Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, George Lucas,
        Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Bong Joon-Ho, Alfred Hitchcock, Katheryn Bigelow, Quentin Tarantino, Hayao Miyazaki, and many more. I talk more <a href="blogs/movies.html">here.</a>
        <br><br>
        I am a big fan of Star Wars. A character I really like is <a href="blogs/star_wars.html" style="color: inherit; text-decoration:none">Admiral Raddus</a>, who made his appearance in "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story."
